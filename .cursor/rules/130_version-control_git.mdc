# Version Control

This project uses **Git** for version control with repositories hosted on **GitHub**.

## Git Best Practices

- Use `git mv <src> <dst>` for renaming or moving files to preserve history
- Commit frequently with logical, self-contained changes
- Don't commit generated files, credentials, or large binary files
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files (build artifacts, cache files, etc.)

## Conventional Commits

Use the [Conventional Commits](mdc:https:/www.conventionalcommits.org) specification for commit messages:

When suggesting or writing commit messages (e.g. in review-changes), follow the project's Conventional Commits rules from `commitlint.config.ts` and `.opencommit-commitlint`.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

- **Header**: `type(scope): subject` — max **80 characters**.
- **Body**: optional; **blank line** after subject; each line max **100 characters**.
- **Footer**: optional; **blank line** before footer; each line max **100 characters**.

## Type (required, lower-case)

One of: `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `feature`, `fix`, ``, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`.


Types include:

- **build**: Change the build and deployment of the project, including docker, k8s, helm charts or Nomad jobs
- **ci**: Change the SDLC, CI/CD delivery or release process
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **revert**: Revert another commit
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning
- **perf**: Changes that affect performance
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

## Scope (optional, lower-case)

e.g. component or file name. Use lower-case.

## Subject (required)

- **Imperative**, short description of the change.
- **No** sentence-case, start-case, pascal-case, or upper-case.
- **No** trailing period.
- Not empty.

## Issue references (optional)

Supported prefixes: `ANDR-`, `TEST-`, `DSC-`, `NABLA-`, `JM-`.

## Git Flow Model

This project follows the Git Flow branching model:

- **main**: Production-ready code only
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feat/**: New functionality (branch from and merge to develop)
- **release/**: Preparing for a release (branch from develop, merge to main and develop)
- **hotfix/**: Urgent production fixes (branch from main, merge to main and develop)

## Workflow

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature develop`
1. Make changes and commit regularly using `cz`
1. Push to remote: `git push -u origin feature/new-feature`
1. Open pull request to develop branch
1. After code review and testing, merge to develop
